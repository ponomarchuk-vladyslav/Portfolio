            <p>
                I had to make this website for a Job Preparation class, to showcase my projects. At the same time, I had
                4 more projects to do, and a couple assignments on top. Also, the github links for most projects are
                forks because the original is private and doesn't belong to me (directly).
            </p>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>
                This portfolio website contains the projects I am proud of, because I did a lot more of them, but they're
                not good enough to showcase. While this portfolio is mostly meant for programming/technical projects, I
                felt like the Animation project was something I should show, because I'm proud of it. It's neat.
