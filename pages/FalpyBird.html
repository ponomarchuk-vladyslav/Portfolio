                <h3>Context</h3>
                <div class="textbox">
                    <p>Done as a project for our Application Development class, this app is the result of around 2
                        months of work with a language we didn't know (Kotlin + Compose), in a team of 3. We faced a lot
                        of issues, both technical and team-related, but we managed to deliver a quality product, with
                        all our planned features, and even some extras!</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <div class="textbox">
                    <p>
                        This is a Flappy Bird clone, but with some added features, such as skins (different sprites for
                        your bird), a "gambling" section where you can use your currency (that you earn by playing) to
                        roll for skins, high score/leaderboard and accounts using FireBase. Most of my work was on the
                        game part itself (which presented many challenges, from sounds to sprites display), along with
                        the settings screen and parts of the design of many pages. I also created the initial design
                        sketches for all the screens.
