        <h3>Context</h3>
        <div class="textbox">
          <p>This project was done for my programming 3 class, during my 2nd semester, in cooperation with another
            student.
            At that point I had a lot more knowledge, including lists, classes, WPF for display and a remake of the
            "engine" of my programming 1 project.
            Unfortunately, this project had it's own share of problems, mainly because it was a team project.
            Me and my teammate split the project in two, with me doing the "backend" (game logic, saving, etc.) and them
            doing the "frontend" (screens, screen design, etc.).
            However, there were some issues with connecting the front and back end, so I took over a part of the front
            end, bringing the project to completion.
          </p>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <div class="textbox">
          <p>
            In a lot of ways, this is the next version of the programming 1 project.
            It's based on the improved engine of that project, although the enemies are not moving, and there's no
            ranged combat.
            The main inspiration for it was <a href="https://watabou.itch.io/pixel-dungeon">Pixel Dungeon</a>, both for
            the style and gameplay.
            Instead, because of the requirement for the number of screens, we made the combat a separate screen, along
            with an inventory system.
            While WPF is not the idea solution for games, it's still better than my previous terminal implementation.
            Overall, it's far better than my previous project, both in look and feel, and showcases my progress in
            programming.
