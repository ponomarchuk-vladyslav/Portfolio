  <h1>My first project!</h1>
  <p>My first project, done on my first year of college!</p>
  <p>I lacked a lot of technical knowledge back then, no lists, classes or objects, but even with this limited knowledge I still succeeded.</p>
  <p>The display is also lacking, being a terminal window, which has issues with quickly "rendering", colors, and as it turns out, being recorded.</p>
  <p>The game itself has a very simple premise, zombies are spawning to kill you, you must survive as long as possible.</p>

  <p>Gameplay preview. Unfortunately, GitHub doesn't accept files over 25mb, so I had to compress it.</p>
