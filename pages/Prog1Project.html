            <p>
                This project was done as my programming 1 final project, during my first semester.
                I was already somewhat familiar with programming when starting the program, because I learned
                how to code in Python when I was 12,
                however my general programming knowledge and specific C# knowledge was still pretty limited.
                It's a miracle that this project was as good as it is, because I didn't even know how to use
                lists, let alone objects, classes or pathfinding.

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>
                The premise of this game is simple: Zombies are coming from all sides, you must survive as long
                as possible.
                You can move around and shoot in cardinal directions.
                Code-wise, the game is terrible: the zombies are not objects, their health and position is
                stored in different arrays, connected together by a single index.
                Because it's arrays, there's always a hundred zombies that never truly die, they just reset and
                return to the edge.
                The display is also not good, I optimized it as much as I could, but there's a limit as to how
                fast the terminal can render text, so there's constant flickering, but if I followed my original
                plan of having colors, it wouldn't fully render the screen in time before the next render.
                Overall, I did a lot with very little knowledge, but there's still a lot of room for
                improvement.
